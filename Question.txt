1. I can not make http get request for the follwing API due to CORS issue

GET assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/pilots/:serialNumber
GET assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/drones


ng build --configuration production

Hi Ahmad,

Thanks for your email! The API isn't intended for direct usage with web browsers, so we are not adding CORS headers to the responses. Consider that taking an approach like that would also fail another objective of the assignment, which is to immediately display the same data from the past 10 minutes to all users.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Regards,
Daria
